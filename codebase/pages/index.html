			<h3>CodeBase is a non-profit UC Berkeley student organization that develops and designs software, websites, and apps for companies with a vision. We help businesses take their innovative ideas to concrete production and create a fast-paced, project-based working environment for Berkeley students. CodeBase aims to offer quality feedback on the needs and objectives of startups based in the Bay Area. For startups without technical talent, or for those in need of more, transforming a company from an idea to a business can be difficult. CodeBase alleviates growing pains and accelerates growth by helping startups refine and advance their technical plan.</h3>
